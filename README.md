# Is Element In Viewport... is it?
Check whether an element is fully in viewport or not.

The usage:
Import the isElementInViewport module, passing the element you need to check and the section you want to be the trigger of all.
Section values:
"top", if you want to wait just for the top of the element to be inside the viewport
"bottom", if you want to wait for the whole element to be inside the viewport

Feel free to ask questions if you have any.
